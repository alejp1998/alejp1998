## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate developer exploring the exciting intersections of web development, robotics, and artificial intelligence. ðŸ¤–ðŸ’»ðŸ§ 

My biggest coding achievement to date is [WiseSloth.app](https://wisesloth.app), a web application that transforms text into interactive quizzes. It's designed to make learning fun and engaging by allowing users to track their progress and compete with friends.

Currently, I'm deeply immersed in developing a web-based drone swarm simulation. This project allows users to interact with and control a swarm of drones using natural language commands. Powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) agent, your messages are interpreted, and the corresponding actions are executed in real-time within the simulation.
